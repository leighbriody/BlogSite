								<h3>Overview , What is Walkies ?</h3>
								<p>Walkies is a  mobile application which I am am going to build for my final year project.It will allow users to register and sign in as a dog walker or dog owner. Dog owners can find and hire a dog walker to come walk their dog when they are not able to. Dog walkers can look and find dogs to walk in order to receive a payment and earn an income..</p>

								<h3>How did I get this idea?</h3>
								<p>The idea from this project came from my recent awareness that I and others included sometimes face a problem with owning a pet. It is hard to find 365 days of the year where you have the time to give them the exercise they need. I have experienced this first hand. I have always had a pet dog throughout my life. Growing up myself and my dad would regularly bring them for walks and adventures, and they were always well exercised and looked after. But we found that at times there would be a day where both myself and my dad were busy. This meant that for the day our dog was sitting with no one to walk him. At times we would rely on my cousin to call over, but of course, there were days when he was also busy.</p>



								<p> During the summer of 2021, I thought to myself “I’m sure there’s an app I can download to hire someone to walk my dog  ? This could be the answer to my problem”. With that in mind, I headed to the app store to which I was disappointed to find no available apps in my country. I couldn’t believe it. Knowing how useful I and many others would find this app I was shocked to see that there was nonavailable. However, I did find out that there was an American company that goes by the name of <strong><a href="https://wagwalking.com/">  Wag! </a></strong> that has the same application. At first glance across their website, it seemed to be doing very well, which led me to believe that this in fact could be done. I kept this thought in my head as an idea for a fourth-year final project. I had not decided on it fully as I still wanted to explore other options. After a couple of weeks of gathering the requirements and thinking about it a lot more, I had decided that I was going to give it a shot and try to build my very own mobile application to solve this problem. </p>

								<h3>Why am I working on this idea ? </h3>
								<p>Dogs are very special to my heart. My grandfather has been training dogs since he was 7 years old and growing up he would often take me out with them on training sessions and teach me how to treat and be with them. With this constant surrounding with them along with having a pet dog all my life, I know how important the wellbeing of our pets is to us.  At times I would often care about my dogs' health more so than my own and I am confident that a lot of other people are the same.</p>
								
								<p>With this being said I also believe that many other people face the same problem as myself. Not always having the time to give them the walk they deserve. Feeling a sense that I would be able to solve this real-world problem through the use of my development skills is a very powerful and motivating feeling. If I can solve or even help in solving this large problem four years into my studies , what great problems will I be able to solve 10 years down the line. With this in mind and the passion for helping to solve this problem pushing me forward it was time to put the skills I have developed over the course of the last three years to use ! </p>

								<h3>What technical knowledge do I bring to this project ? </h3>
								<p>I am currently in the fourth year of my Computer Science degree at Dundalk institute of technology. This year we are specializing in cloud computing. But over the last three years, I have developed some technical skills that have given me the tools to be able to build this application. Over the last three years, we have covered programming fundamental concepts which I have found can transfer over and make learning a new language a lot easier. I learned in-depth about the concepts of Object-Oriented Programming and built a three-tier web application using Java. I then partially transferred this web application over to a .NET web application and hosted it using azure. In the second year I briefly covered Vue.js the JavaScript framework, I used this with PHP and MySQL to build a small-scale furniture management system.</p>

								<p>I am currently halfway through my first semester of final year and have built two small mobile apps using Ionic, angular, and firebase.  I have found that having small but some experience with Vue.js has made picking up angular a lot easier. One of these applications consumed a rest API to help find hotels and the other one uses firebases firestore database. These skills will be transferred over and widely used within my main project.  These two small apps have given me a good understanding of how I would go about building my final project and I believe I have acquired the skills over the last three years to build a great application..</p>

<div class="row justify-content-center pt-4 py-md-5">

						</div>

								<p>I have gathered all my application requirements and currently have a clear understanding of the applications flow and all the different  user scenarios. I am currently in the process of designing my firestore database and my user interface to suit the application requirements..</p>

									<p>There are still some things I wish to implement into this application but have yet to explore and research. I am looking to containerize this application using Docker. I am also looking to use some amazon web services to improve this application. Although I have no experience with docker , and little with Amazon Web Services I am confident that trough my research and studies I will be able to use these services to vastly improve my application
Keep an eye out on this blog for future updates and progress <br>
